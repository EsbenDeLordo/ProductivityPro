1. Big-Picture Goals

    Scaling dropshipping to $X/month.

    Growing content platform (YouTube, TikTok, IG, etc.).

    Maximizing daily productivity while avoiding burnout.

    Long-term health and cognitive performance.

2. Daily Execution & Structure

    Deep Work Blocks – 90-120 minute focus sessions (Huberman-style).

    Batching & Automation – Content and dropshipping tasks handled in structured sprints.

    Prioritization – Eisenhower Matrix & 80/20 rule to focus on high-impact tasks.

    Evening Wind-Down – Low light, no screens before bed (to optimize sleep).

3. Optimization Strategies & Protocols
Huberman Lab Protocols:

    Morning Sunlight – 10-30 min of outdoor light exposure within 60 min of waking.

    Cold Exposure – Cold showers or ice baths for dopamine & resilience.

    NSDR (Non-Sleep Deep Rest) – Yoga Nidra or deep breathing for midday energy boosts.

    Caffeine Timing – No caffeine in the first 90 min after waking to avoid afternoon crashes.

Atomic Habits (James Clear) Principles:

    Habit Stacking – Pairing new habits with existing routines (e.g., stretching while listening to a podcast).

    2-Minute Rule – Making new habits easy to start (e.g., “just do 1 push-up” to build consistency).

    Environment Design – Structuring surroundings to encourage good habits (e.g., keeping water, supplements, or a to-do list visible).

High-Performance Protocols Worth Adding:

    Sleep Optimization (Dr. Matthew Walker) – Prioritizing 7-9 hours with deep sleep focus.

    Focus Cycling (Ultradian Rhythms) – Working in natural energy peaks (90 min on, 20 min off).

    Supplements (Nootropics, Adaptogens, Omega-3s) – Enhancing cognition and energy.

    Breathwork (Wim Hof / Box Breathing) – Increasing oxygen efficiency and stress resilience.

    Strength & Cardio Balance – Resistance training + Zone 2 cardio for longevity and endurance.

4. Challenges & Solutions

    Avoiding Burnout – Implementing active recovery (light movement, NSDR, proper sleep).

    Maximizing Learning – Spaced repetition & active recall (Anki, mental models).

    Distraction Management – Reducing notifications, using time-blocking, and setting clear work boundaries.
